Chess Rules
Chess game goal:
The ultimate aim in the chess game is delivering a checkmate – trapping your opponent´s king.

General Chess Rules:
White is always first to move and players take turns alternately moving one piece at a time. Movement is required.
 If a player´s turn is to move, he is not in check but has no legal moves, this situation is called “Stalemate” and it ends the game in a draw.
Each type of piece has its own method of movement.
A piece may be moved to another position or may capture an opponent´s piece, replacing on its square (en passant being the only exception).
With the exception of the knight, a piece may not move over or through any of the other pieces.
When a king is threatened with capture (but can protect himself or escape), it´s called check.
If a king is in check, then the player must make a move that eliminates the threat of capture and cannot leave the king in check.
Checkmate happens when a king is placed in check and there is no legal move to escape.
Checkmate ends the game and the side whose king was checkmated looses. 
Chess for kids would be a great option to help the kid enhance his thinking capability with the chess strategies involved. 

Pawn promotion:
If a pawn reaches the opponent´s edge of the table, it will be promoted – the pawn may be converted to a queen, rook, bishop or knight, as the player desires. 
The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces. 
Thus its´ theoretically possible having up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all pawns are promoted.

Castle:
if you want to castle (and can do it) press on your king.
